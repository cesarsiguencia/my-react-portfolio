                    <p className="body-texts bold-and-left">So why did I choose coding?</p>

                    <p className="body-texts">
                        When coding, there are undoubtly many challenges, especially when one implements technologies still very foreign to them. But I never get tired of the feel-good/satisfying instant moment I get when something works the way I intended after debugging for some time! It's a simple, yet proud feeling that any developer I'm sure will understand.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        I have always been curious to see how and why something works. Because of this inquisitive nature, I am able to be persistent, so I know that my success in any developer challenge will be inevitable. This is the fulfillment building applications gives me and why challenges fuel these passions even more. </p>

                        For almost five years, I've worked at an East Harlem elementary school in operations. On my own time, you can find me weight training, running, cycling, cooking with loved ones, or relaxing at uptown parks birdwatching and sightseeing. I identify as Latino and speak Spanish and English fluently. I can read and speak Chinese at an intermediate level from courses I took in high school, college, and a summer study abroad. </p>
